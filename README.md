![Linear Algebra](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linear%20Algebra-For%20Data%20Science-blue)

Welcome to the GitHub repository dedicated to the exploration of mathematical concepts relevant to data science, taught in the Linear Algebra for Data Science course at Asan Medical Center's MI2RL. The goal of this repository is to implement these mathematical concepts using Python.

## Course Overview

This course focuses on bridging the gap between linear algebra and its applications in data science. We delve into various mathematical concepts such as vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and more, exploring how they form the backbone of many algorithms and techniques in data science.

## Getting Started

To get started with the implementations and exercises, clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/linear-algebra-for-data-science.git
```

Feel free to explore the folders and files containing Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and resources related to the course material.
